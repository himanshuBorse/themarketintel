					<p>
						Over the last 2 years, semiconductor chip shortage has been one of the critical issues in the
						tech, electronics, and automotive industries. The unavailability of chip set and electronics
						components have materially impacted businesses in terms of revenue and customer experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						The shortage of semiconductor chips started early in the pandemic wherein the government
						enforced lock downs across nations. As a result, factories have been shut down for months
						resulting in production halting and businesses stopped ordering new chips and components being
						part of the Just-in-time (JIT) supply chain. This strategy has failed as demand for specific
						consumer electronics and appliances such as laptops, mobile phones/smartphones, personal care
						devices, and home appliances have increased greatly across the globe. This demand is attributed
						to the change in consumer behavior, remote work and education culture influenced by the
						pandemic.
					</p>
					<p>
						The global industry has seen a bullwhip effect due to supply chain crisis on the supply side
						leading to higher lead time for delivery of chips and unprecedented demand at the end-consumers.
						In addition to this, the automotive sector also demands a sizable number of chip sets and
						lacking single components can hamper the production cycle of automotive vehicles. Also,
						automotive ecosystem is highly dependent on Tier1, Tier2, and Tier3 suppliers, which are prone
						to supply chain disruption to a larger extent. <a
							href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3128060/tsmc-spend-us100-billion-over-three-years-grow-chip-capacity">
							Automotive industry has estimated to loss revenue of USD (US Dollar) 60 billion in 2021 due
							to chip shortage.</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						To cope with higher customer demand and supply chain crisis, businesses in tech, electronics,
						and automotive have started developing short- and long-term strategies to streamline production
						of chips and shorten lead time. Businesses adopted key strategies, including visibility into
						supply chain, inventory management, predicting supply and demand with the help of analytic and
						AI tools and strengthening physical supply chain by improving transportation and logistics
						capabilities in a short term.
					</p>
					<p>
						On a top of that, as a part of long-term strategy, businesses are also localizing and
						diversifying supply chain with the help of signing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), near shoring,
						opening new production facilities in the North America, Europe, Latin America, and Southeast
						Asia considering current production of semiconductor chip sets manufacturers are in Northeast
						Asia, China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, which is hub of fabless semiconductor companies
						namely MediaTek, TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), and UMC.
					</p>
					<p>
						Government authorities also acknowledge the shortage of semiconductor chips affecting businesses
						and economies at a higher level. Hence, several initiatives have been undertaken by US (United
						States), UK (United Kingdom), European Union, China, Japan, India, and South Korea to support
						businesses with the help of amendment in the existing regulations, policies, and heavy capital
						funding to develop new production facilities across region.
					</p>
					<h3>
						Following are the key Initiatives undertaken by businesses and government authorities
					</h3>
					<p>
						<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_729">Europe Chip Act</a>:
						The European Chips Act will help businesses strengthen R&D (Research & Development), innovation,
						and development in the semiconductor industry. Approximately 43 billion Euros fund announced
						with the inclusion of public and private investment to support this initiative. It will help the
						EU (European Union) to achieve its goal of reaching 20% of the market share in chips by 2030.

					<h3>
						Impact on the global supply chain
					</h3>
					<p>
						The large-scale developments in the localization and diversification of supply chain would
						create a new revenue opportunity for all stakeholders, specifically supply chain and logistics
						players. The sustainable long-term roadmap can help logistics players to support sectors’ agenda
						to localize and globalize the supply chain by developing a strong and resilient regional and
						global logistics infrastructure. It is imperative for logistics sector to find favorable
						near-shoring locations (South America, central and eastern Europe, MEA, and Southeast Asia) and
						build an infrastructure route with the combination of road and rail (regional and local supply
						chain) and sea and air (diversified supply chain). Moreover, technology and innovations will
						help to bridge the gap between supply chain crisis at upstream and midstream and uneven demand
						at the downstream level with the help of visibility at each stage and sharing critical
						information across value chain to make informed decision in advance. The risk sharing in the
						supply chain will play a significant role during disruption wherein businesses can collaborate
						to share their digital and infrastructure resources to help mitigate larger impact on business
						revenue.
